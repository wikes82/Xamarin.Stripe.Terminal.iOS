 This variant of the initializer lets you specify a [Location](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/locations) to filter the

 This filtering behavior is only available when discovering internet readers.
 Starting a `discoverReaders` call with a bluetooth discovery method will
 discover all bluetooth readers that can be found, regardless of the location
 to which those readers have been registered.

 @param discoveryMethod    The discovery method to use.

 @param locationId         The optional location ID to filter the discovered
 list to only readers at the specific location. Currently updating and creating
 locations is not supported by this SDK and will need to take place on the
 backend. Only available for the Internet discovery method.
